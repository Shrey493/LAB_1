(a) Water Fall: Because our needs are clear and the Waterfall approach is appropriate for small projects, we can utilise it to create a 
straightforward data processing project.

(b) Prototyping: Client engagement (feedback), which is crucial because we need to make our solution user-friendly, is quite significant. 
Therefore, we have two options: the prototyping model and the evolutionary model.

(c) Incremental:We can use the incremental model since we need numerous features that can be implemented utilising fundamental characteristics. 
We can implement the fundamental features first, and then add extra features that rely on them.

(d) Agile: We can employ the Agile model in this situation because the requirements are changing quickly andÂ an internal development team 
accessible for all elements of the project.

(e) Agile: Here the Requirement is frequent changes so agile can be a good option

(f) Spiral: Risk assesment is major concern here, so spiral model can be beneficial.

(g) Evolutionary: Virtual reality systems require ongoing development and adaptation to changing maintenance requirements; for this project, 
the evolutionary model will work well.

(h) Water Fall: We need to replace an existing system, so the Water Fall model is the best suit here.

(i) Incremental: The evolutionary model will work well for this project because virtual reality systems need to be constantly improved and 
adjusted to changing maintenance requirements.

(j) Spiral: The Spiral model focuses on risk assessment which is the major part in our project that needs to be considered.

(k) Agile:In situations like these, where we must react quickly to shifting requirements, the agile model excels.

(l) Spiral: The Spiral model can be used in this situation since it works best when prospective hazards can have negative effects.

(m) Water Fall: We can utilise the Waterfall approach for this project because there won't be any changes to the requirements, and it is ideal for projects with clear 
requirements and few potential changes.
